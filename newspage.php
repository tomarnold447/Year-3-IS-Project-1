				<h2><br>Ventolin inhalers are<br> <span>50% off </span>from May to July</h2>
				<p>Ventolin Evohaler contains a medicine called salbutamol. This belongs to a group of medicines called fast acting bronchodilators.

Bronchodilators help the airways in your lungs to stay open. This makes it easier for air to get in and out.
They help to relieve chest tightness, wheezing and cough.
Ventolin Evohaler is used to treat breathing problems in people with asthma and similar conditions. This includes relieving and preventing asthma brought on by exercise or other “triggers”. These are things, which bring on asthma symptoms in some people. Common triggers include house dust, pollen, cats, dogs and cigarette smoke.</p>
